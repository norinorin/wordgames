# Wordgames

A rust implementation of [PixelSam123's java wordgames](https://github.com/PixelSam123/wordgames4j).
Word bank retrieved from [Datamuse](https://www.datamuse.com/api/).
I worked on this as a learning project, so things may be subpar.

## Spinning it up

Simply run the binary, or `cargo run`

## Demonstration

This also works on [PixelSam123's client](https://pixelsam123.github.io/minigames). Put in `wss://play.norin.me/{ROUTE}`
